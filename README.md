# This is my vim configuration

## Install

## Introduction
A lot of people have vim configurations and dot file repos. This one is designed to be
easy to use as well as being configurable.
The vimrc file that comes included should be easy to understand and configure.

Many people who are new to vim are encouraged to steal other people's configurations. I
generally do not encourage this behavior, but I do see the value in it.
That being said, I recognize that the learning process for vim can be difficult. Consider
this a shortcut that will help you get started.

This configuration is aimed at being light on plugins in order to encourage the use of
what vim has to offer. My philosophy is don't use a plugin unless it does something that
vim does not do by default (i.e. snippets). With this in mind, I despise YouCompleteMe.

## Features
I use the wonderful vim-plug (https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) for my plugin manager
This is what my config is using:
* vim-snipmate (https://github.com/garbas/vim-snipmate)
..* in terms of snippets, I borrowed most from (https://github.com/honza/vim-snippets), but some are homemade
